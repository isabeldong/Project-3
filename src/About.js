          Hi ðŸ‘‹ Weâ€™re four college students who care about personal finance, improving financial literarcy, and helping students save money.
        </p>
        <p>
        We want our app to help you track your earnings and spending so that you can gain deeper insights into your personal finances.
        </p>
        <p>
        Weâ€™ve tried out many apps to track our spending, such as Mint, NerdWallet, and Rockey Money, but theyâ€™ve all been both needlessly complicated and didnâ€™t have the exact features we wanted. So, we created a simple and intuitive app with the most important features you would need to start your personal finance journey!
